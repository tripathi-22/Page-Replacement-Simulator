# Efficient Algorithm Simulator for Page Replacement

An interactive Python utility called Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator illustrates the FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms. It visualizes cumulative page faults and simulation phases using Matplotlib and a Tkinter GUI.

## Features: LRU and FIFO algorithms are simulated.
A detailed record of the simulation's happenings.
A graph that displays cumulative page defects in real time.

## Requirements: Matplotlib (install with `pip install matplotlib`) and Python 3.

## Application
1. Make a clone of the repository.
2. Set up dependencies.
3. Type ```bash python simulator.py to launch the simulator.
